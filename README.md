<p>Hi there, my name is Samuel groot Wassink. I am a junior freelance web developer based in Utrecht, The Netherlands. </p>
<p> Until now I have worked with a mix of back-end and front-end as I mainly develop WordPress themes from scratch.</p>
<p>At this day and age however I am taking a deeper dive into front-end development as I am learning Vue.JS and React.JS</p>
<p>Would you want to reach me, do this by emailing me at: info@samuelgrootwassink.nl</p>
